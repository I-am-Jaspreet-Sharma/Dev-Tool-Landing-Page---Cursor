## 🎨 Design Decisions

* **Dark Background (#0b0b0b)** for modern developer aesthetic
* **Soft borders (#222)** to separate sections subtly
* **Large typography for hierarchy**
* **Fixed container width (1100px)** for desktop-only layout
* **Consistent vertical spacing (120px sections)**

---

## 📐 Layout Strategy

* Used `flexbox` for horizontal alignment
* Used `CSS Grid` for card layouts
* Maintained consistent spacing between sections
* Avoided unnecessary nesting
* Followed clean class naming structure

---

## 🚫 What Was Intentionally Not Included

* No responsiveness
* No animations
* No hover effects
* No JavaScript functionality
* No frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)

This keeps the focus strictly on layout and CSS fundamentals.
